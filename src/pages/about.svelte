                <p>My name is Tim Phillips, I'm a designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful digital products and the systems behind them. I love being able to immerse myself into the project at hand and create (hopefully) more intuitive outcomes. I also am passionate about the role front end web development plays within the design process of digital products.</p>
                <p>I studied Graphic Design, at Swinburne University, successfully earning a Diploma in Graphic Design (2011) and a Bachelor in Communication Design (2012). After studying, from 2012 - 2015 I worked predominantly in the print/graphic design industry. Working as a designer in a small design studio, helping build and grow a local clothing company's brand identity and textile graphics range and also providing design and communications services for a Federal MP. </p>
                <p>In 2015, I transitioned into digital design, specifically web, and have since devoted myself to enhancing and growing my skillset and knowledge as designer / developer within the context of the web.</p>
